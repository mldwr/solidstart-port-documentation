In Next.js and SolidStart, file-based routing serves as the core navigation model, but each framework has its own conventions for defining routes and handling nested structures.

## Routing

### 1. Overview: Routing in Next.js vs. SolidStart

#### Next.js (App Router)
- Next.js uses a file-based routing system, where routes are defined inside the `app/` directory.
- Each folder and file in `app/` automatically creates a corresponding route.
- Pages are created by placing `page.tsx` files in folders. Nested folders create nested routes.
- `layout.tsx` files provide persistent layouts that can be shared across multiple routes, and `loading.tsx` files handle loading states.

#### SolidStart
- SolidStart also employs a file-based routing system, typically in the `src/routes` directory.
- Each file within `src/routes` corresponds to a route, and nested folders create nested routes.
- SolidStart leverages the file names directly for routing, with `index.tsx` serving as the default page for a directory.

### 2. Example Comparison

To help illustrate the difference, let’s go through an example. Suppose your Next.js app has the following structure:

#### Next.js Folder Structure
```
app/
├── dashboard/
│   ├── page.tsx
│   ├── settings/
│   │   ├── page.tsx
│   └── layout.tsx
├── about/
│   ├── page.tsx
│   ├── loading.tsx
│   └── layout.tsx
└── page.tsx
```

**Explanation:**
- `/dashboard` and `/about` are top-level routes.
- `dashboard/settings` is a nested route under `/dashboard`.
- `layout.tsx` provides a layout for its folder and its nested routes.
- `loading.tsx` specifies a loading screen for the `/about` route.

#### Equivalent SolidStart Folder Structure
To replicate this in SolidStart:

```
src/routes/
├── dashboard/
│   ├── index.tsx
│   ├── settings/
│   │   └── index.tsx
│   └── layout.tsx
├── about/
│   ├── index.tsx
│   ├── loading.tsx
│   └── layout.tsx
└── index.tsx
```

**Explanation:**
- In SolidStart, `index.tsx` is used to represent the main page of each route folder.
- `layout.tsx` works similarly to Next.js by providing a persistent layout for nested routes within its directory.
- You can create a loading screen for `/about` with `loading.tsx`, similar to Next.js.

### 3. Example Code

Let’s go through the code for each framework, demonstrating the basic components for both a top-level route and a nested route.

#### Next.js - `app/dashboard/layout.tsx`
```typescript
// app/dashboard/layout.tsx
export default function DashboardLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Dashboard Layout</h1>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### SolidStart - `src/routes/dashboard/layout.tsx`
```typescript
// src/routes/dashboard/layout.tsx
import { Outlet } from 'solid-start';

export default function DashboardLayout() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Dashboard Layout</h1>
      <Outlet />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 4. Nested Route Example

For nested routes, here’s how you would define the `dashboard/settings` page in each framework:

#### Next.js - `app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx`
```typescript
// app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx
export default function SettingsPage() {
  return <div>Settings Page</div>;
}
```

#### SolidStart - `src/routes/dashboard/settings/index.tsx`
```typescript
// src/routes/dashboard/settings/index.tsx
export default function SettingsPage() {
  return <div>Settings Page</div>;
}
```

### 5. Handling Dynamic Routes

Dynamic routes are handled similarly but with syntax differences:
- **Next.js**: Create `[id].tsx` for dynamic routes.
- **SolidStart**: Use `[param].tsx` in `src/routes` for dynamic routes.

#### Next.js - Dynamic Route Example
```typescript
// app/dashboard/[id]/page.tsx
export default function DashboardItem({ params }) {
  return <div>Item ID: {params.id}</div>;
}
```

#### SolidStart - Dynamic Route Example
```typescript
// src/routes/dashboard/[id].tsx
import { useParams } from 'solid-start';

export default function DashboardItem() {
  const params = useParams();
  return <div>Item ID: {params.id}</div>;
}
```

### Key Differences in Porting
1. **Folders and Filenames**: Replace `page.tsx` in Next.js with `index.tsx` in SolidStart.
2. **`layout.tsx` Usage**: Use `layout.tsx` similarly in both frameworks, with SolidStart's `Outlet` replacing Next.js’s `{ children }`.
3. **Loading Screens**: Rename `loading.tsx` files as needed and maintain them within the same route structure.

Using these examples, you can start translating your Next.js routing structure to SolidStart with minimal effort.

## Default routing
In Next.js, route groups like `(overview)` allow you to organize routes and designate default or grouped routes. To replicate this in SolidStart, you can use SolidStart’s default route mechanism with `index.tsx`, but there are some differences in structure, as SolidStart doesn’t use route groups in the same way.

Here's how you can port your Next.js route structure to SolidStart.

### 1. Next.js Structure
Your Next.js folder structure looks like this:
```
app/
└── dashboard/
    ├── (overview)/
    │   └── page.tsx        // Default overview route for /dashboard
    ├── invoices/
    │   └── page.tsx        // Route for /dashboard/invoices
    └── customers/
        └── page.tsx        // Route for /dashboard/customers
```

- In this structure, `(overview)` acts as the default route when you navigate to `/dashboard`.
  
### 2. Porting to SolidStart
In SolidStart, you can achieve a similar structure by using `index.tsx` as the default page within `src/routes/dashboard/`. Here’s what the equivalent folder structure would look like in SolidStart:

```
src/
└── routes/
    └── dashboard/
        ├── index.tsx        // Default overview route for /dashboard
        ├── invoices/
        │   └── index.tsx    // Route for /dashboard/invoices
        └── customers/
            └── index.tsx    // Route for /dashboard/customers
```

### Explanation
1. **`index.tsx`**: In SolidStart, `index.tsx` within the `dashboard` folder acts as the default route for `/dashboard`, replacing `(overview)` in Next.js.
2. **Nested Routes**: For each sub-route like `/dashboard/invoices` and `/dashboard/customers`, create their own folders with `index.tsx` inside. 

### Code Examples

#### SolidStart - `src/routes/dashboard/index.tsx`
This file corresponds to the default "overview" route (`/dashboard`) in SolidStart:

```javascript
export default function DashboardOverview() {
  return <div>Overview of the Dashboard</div>;
}
```

#### SolidStart - `src/routes/dashboard/invoices/index.tsx`
This file corresponds to `/dashboard/invoices`:

```javascript
export default function Invoices() {
  return <div>Invoices Page</div>;
}
```

#### SolidStart - `src/routes/dashboard/customers/index.tsx`
This file corresponds to `/dashboard/customers`:

```javascript
export default function Customers() {
  return <div>Customers Page</div>;
}
```

### Summary
In SolidStart:
- Use `index.tsx` within `dashboard` to act as the default route (`/dashboard`), similar to Next.js’s `(overview)`.
- For nested routes, create folders for each route (like `invoices` and `customers`), and place `index.tsx` inside to handle routes like `/dashboard/invoices` and `/dashboard/customers`.

This approach provides the same user experience in SolidStart without the need for route groups.
